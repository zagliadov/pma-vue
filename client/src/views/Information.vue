          which the Earth moves. Fresnel's partial ether dragging hypothesis
          ruled out the measurement of first-order (v/c) effects, and although
          observations of second-order effects (v2/c2) were possible in

          then-current technology.

          For athletes, high altitude produces two contradictory effects on
          performance. For explosive events (sprints up to 400 metres, long
          jump, triple jump) the reduction in atmospheric pressure means there
          is less resistance from the atmosphere and the athlete's performance
          will generally be better at high altitude.

          Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although
          modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a
          boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept
          of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an
          understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement
          continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a
          relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.

          Maxwell's equations—the foundation of classical
          electromagnetism—describe light as a wave that moves with a
          characteristic velocity. The modern view is that light needs no medium
          of transmission, but Maxwell and his contemporaries were convinced
          that light waves were propagated in a medium, analogous to sound
          propagating in air, and ripples propagating on the surface of a pond.
          This hypothetical medium was called the luminiferous aether, at rest
          relative to the "fixed stars" and through which the Earth moves.
          Fresnel's partial ether dragging hypothesis ruled out the measurement
          of first-order (v/c) effects, and although observations of
          second-order effects (v2/c2) were possible in principle, Maxwell
          thought they were too small to be detected with then-current
          technology.
